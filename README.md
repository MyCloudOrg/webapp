All students must use the GitHub forking workflow and their repositories (main branch which must include code for this assignment) must be in sync. Check this by asking students to create pull requests between their main branch and their assignment branch. There should be no changes. Verify that all assignment changes are to the main branch.

Verify that students have added TAs as collaborators to the GitHub repository.

Verify that students have README.md file in their git repository and it contains instructions on how to build, test and deploy their application including any prerequisites for a programming language, frameworks, and third-party libraries.
